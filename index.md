### Why This Page Was Made

I've tried watching videos on how to style outfits and find my unique aesthetic in outfits, so instead of writing them in a cluttered Doc, I'm going to write anything interesting I learn here. 

## Color Schemes

* Never try having neon and pastel in one outfit
  * It's distracting and doesn't fit well together
 

## Links 'N Stuff

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/NinaG429/StyleCite.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/NinaG429/StyleCite.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
